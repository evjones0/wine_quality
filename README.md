# Wine Quality Analysis

This represents the complete analytics workflow for estimating wine quality of red and white "Vinho Verde" wines from Northwestern Portugal.

To view a fully-rendered version of this analysis, open the file "analytics_workflow.html" in your web browser.

To view the R-markdown version of this same document, open the file "analytics_workflow.Rmd" in root. It's recommended that you clone a copy of this git repository to your local file system before compiling. This markdown file relies on two files: "data_summary.R" which is located in  \external_functions and "refs.bib" in root.

For convience, copies of the red and white datasets are located in the \datasets folder in the event that the data is delisted by University of California, Irvine. The R-markdown script currently does not rely on these local copies.
